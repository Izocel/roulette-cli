In roulette, the payout depends on the type of bet you place. The house will give you back your original bet plus any winnings based on the odds of that specific bet. Hereâ€™s a summary of how it works for different bet types:

1. **Even-Money Bets (1:1 Payout):**

   - Examples: Red/Black, Odd/Even, High/Low
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $20 in winnings, for a total of $40.

2. **Column and Dozen Bets (2:1 Payout):**

   - Examples: Betting on one of the three columns or dozens (1-12, 13-24, 25-36)
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $40 in winnings, for a total of $60.

3. **Single Number Bets (35:1 Payout):**

   - Example: Betting on a specific number (straight-up bet)
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $700 in winnings, for a total of $720.

4. **Split Bets (17:1 Payout):**

   - Example: Betting on two adjacent numbers
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $340 in winnings, for a total of $360.

5. **Street Bets (11:1 Payout):**

   - Example: Betting on a row of three numbers
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $220 in winnings, for a total of $240.

6. **Corner Bets (8:1 Payout):**

   - Example: Betting on four numbers forming a square
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $160 in winnings, for a total of $180.

7. **Six Line Bets (5:1 Payout):**
   - Example: Betting on two adjacent rows of three numbers
   - If you bet $20 and win, you get your $20 back plus $100 in winnings, for a total of $120.

In summary, the amount you win varies based on the type of bet you place, with higher-risk bets offering higher payouts. The house edge ensures the casino has an advantage over time, so while you might win some bets, the casino is designed to make a profit overall.
